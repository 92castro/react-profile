          Hi there! I'll start out by saying, thank you. Thank you for taking
          the time to visit my portfolio. My name is Celin Castro, and I was
          born in The Golden State-California, raised in The Great State of
          Texas, and now I live in Colorful Colorado! I recently graduated from
          the University of Denver where I completed an intense full-stack web
          development bootcamp and I'm eager to bring my skills and passion to
          the industry. In addition to my technical skills, I have strong
          problem-solving and communication abilities, which I honed through
          various team projects during my bootcamp. I am a quick learner and
          able to work well under pressure. I believe my technical skills,
          combined with my positive attitude, and eagerness to learn, will make
          me a valuable addition to any development team. I look forward to
          using my skills and experience to help organizations build innovative
          and user-friendly websites and technologies.
