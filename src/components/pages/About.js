      <p>
        I'll start out by saying, thank you. Thank you for taking the time for
        visiting my portfolio that is still under construction.. My name is
        Celin Castro, and I was born in The Golden State-California, raised in
        The Great State of Texas, and now I live in Colorful Colorado! I'm
        currently a student at the University of Denver where I'm currently
        attending a coding bootcamp to get ahead in life and find a career. The
        reason I decided to built this page is to introduce myself to the world
        of coding and to showoff my work. There's not much to show, but I
        promise there's more to come!
